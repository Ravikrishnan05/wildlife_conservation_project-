## problem and its utility
Wildlife plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of our ecosystem. It serves various purposes ranging from protecting our biological diversities to maintaining our cultural ethos. Wildlife is indispensable for striking a crucial balance that enables us to live and grow. However, with growing modernization and globalization, we are facing a climate crisis and our wildlife in India is decreasing day by day.my 
69% drop in wildlife populations in nearly 5 decades.
he need for wildlife conservation is about saving the whole planet, the delicate balance needed for life to thrive, and the dependence of everything on one another for survival. Wildlife conservation is not some activity happening in the remote corners of a rainforest or at the edge of the desert.

Itâ€™s a collaborative, global effort needed to ensure that we are taking every measure to keep this planet a whole, where the air is pure, the water is clean, and the ground is fertile. Wildlife conservation is about being responsible, thinking beyond our own lives, and understanding that everything on Earth is connected. And if we destroy one, we will surely pave the way for our own destruction.
